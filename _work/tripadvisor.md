### May 2019 to Present

I am a full stack software developer on the Restaurants B2B team creating products for restaurant owners around the globe.

I work with React, GraphQL, Java, and PostgreSQL to create responsive web applications along with modular and scalable microservices using Java and Postgres. Additionally, we use technologies such as Hive, Snowflake, and Presto for data warehousing and analysis.

While most of the work I do is only visible to restaurant owners, the screenshot above shows this storyboard indicator project that I completed. There is a pre-existing a storyboard feature where owners can published a video slideshow of their restaurant but it was only visible on the restaurant review page. I exposed this on the restaurant search results pages, which receives the highest volume of traffic on the Tripadvisor website. I had to create a solution to expose this information that would scale to tens of millions of requests. That meant querying this data efficiently with cacheing in the right places. As a full stack developer, I also wrote the CSS and HTML to work across every browser and platform and setup tracking metrics for feature evaluation.

### Quotes from Performance Review

> "Andrew is strongest working on the front end in React.  He came to Tripadvisor as the resident expert at his previous company and it shows.  He is very comfortable solving complex problems within the front end and writing elegant fixes that fully utilize the React library..."

> "He's got a great nose for solving problems and making sure they are fixed all the way through... When asking Andrew to investigate a bug, you can be sure he'll find the root cause and not just the surface manifestation."

> "Andrew also communicates well and can articulate technical concepts such as [the billing system]... and convey the appropriate information to stakeholders inside and outside of our team.  He truly embraces #betterTogether (company core value) and is very active in our team demo meetings sharing new features he's worked on.  On a day to day basis he is clear about the projects he's working on, calls out when he's blocked, and works well with others on the team."
