## 2008

As a co-op student, I helped create a carbon emissions offset trading platform. The web-based platform brought carbon emitters and offsetters together in a marketplace for trading carbon credits. The system was in the process of being ported from ColdFusion to PHP RESTful API when I was there. I used tools such as ExtJS and Google Visualizations to create charts and visualizations of emissions data.

Users would use the widgets that I created that would automatically sync with MySql/PHP backend. Of course, I also wrote the SQL for these queries.

The company no longer exists, so I don't not have a good example of my work there, but I did manage to find this blurry screenshot showing some of the widgets that I created.
