### 2015 to 2019

I worked as a senior web application developer for Nokia where I led the web technology modernization efforts for the IP/Optical Networking department. When I joined Nokia, the company was using an outdated web application framework. It required a web browser to download 10MB of JavaScript just to draw a table. It was slow, time-consuming to develop with, and full of bugs. Over the course of several months, I convinced the organization to change using a series of proof-of-concepts and PowerPoint presentations. Today, we have over 80 developers using the foundation that I put in place.

My day to day responsibilities include being the project lead for web applications on the Software Defined Networking (SDN) platform, and providing guidance and consultation for other web application teams. I created web applications in React/Redux to assist internet service roviders (ISPs) in monitoring network traffic and to take action to steer network traffic using BGP and Openflow Protocols.
