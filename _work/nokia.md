### March 2015 to Present

I am a web application developer for Nokia working on applications for Software Defined Networking (SDN). I create web applications in React/Redux that control and monitor various networking solutions using the OpenFlow Protocol.

When I joined Nokia, the company was using an outdated web application framework. It required a web browser to download 10MB of JavaScript just to draw a table. It was slow, time consuming to develop with, and full of bugs. Over the course of several months, I convinced the organization to change with a series of PowerPoint presentations and proof of concepts. I lead the department to modernize their web applications using a new platform based on React/Redux and Webpack. Today, we have over 30 developers using the foundation that I put in place.

My day to day responsibilities include being the project lead for web applications on the SDN platform, and providing guidance and support for other web application teams.
