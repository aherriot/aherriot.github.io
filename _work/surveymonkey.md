### 2020 to Present

I am the Engineering Manager for the Web Experience team. Our mission is to enhance development velocity and ensure consistency across teams by building React-based design system components, improving front-end infrastructure, advocating best practices, and supporting large-scale inter-team projects. Additionally, we develop organization-wide features, such as the site navigation experience.

## Projects

### Design System

SurveyMonkey’s design system is built in React, but before my arrival, 90% of our code base was not using it. As part of a modernization effort, my team led the adoption of the new system, increasing company-wide usage from 10% to over 60%, benefiting hundreds of developers.

Beyond visual modernization, we also upgraded the underlying technology. I led the 100% migration of our design system component library to TypeScript and the replacement of the deprecated CSS-in-JS solution with a modern CSS Modules approach. This unlocked the ability to do SSR, better performance, and more flexibility.

I also directly created performance tests and a visual regression test framework to ensure that we can confidently deliver high-quality components for other teams. In addition to this, I have set up better contribution processes with clear guidance and mentorship for other teams covering topics such as accessibility and architecture.

### Header Navigation Consolidation

We also take on feature development. There were at least 14 different implementations of our site navigation experience across different technologies stacks. This includes features like real-time notifications. Starting with an award-winning hackathon project, I proved that we could consolidate them into a single implementation delivered to many different kinds of applications, both legacy and modern. This has allowed changes to be deployed to production in days instead of months, while also driving modernization and consistency.

### Enterprise Migration

I lead a team to modernize B2B enterprise features on a new web platform based on React / GraphQL. I migrated a substantial portion of our enterprise product over to the new technology stack. This project included lots of mentorship for those around me.

### GraphQL

Re-architected our **GraphQL** layer so that users could query information owned by other users. This was key in order for Admin accounts to be able to view and manager the users on their team. With this in place, I was able to create features such as allowing admins to transfer surveys from one user on their team to another.

### Microservices

Even though my role was strictly a frontend role, I still contributed to **microservices** where needed. The entirety of the GraphQL Schema is defined and maintained by frontend developers at SurveyMonkey. In addition, I contributed to other microservices, for example by adding REST and GraphQL APIs to expose our SOLR search database in a secure way.

> Andrew is one of the main reasons why I love my job. I feel like he really cares about me and our team and does everything he can to help us succeed and feel engaged and happy at work. I love his enthusiasm for our team's products and his dedication for cultivating a healthy and productive environment built on teamwork and trust. He always has my back if I have a problem (regardless if it's technical or non-technical) and I can always count on him if I need anything. I genuinely enjoy talking to him every day in standup and I consider him to be a valuable manager and mentor.

### Quotes from Individual Contributor Performance Reviews

> Andrew has been doing some of the best Graph work I've seen in a while​. I have the unique perspective of being able to compare his contributions from a technical and social aspect and he's been killing it on both fronts. And I'm saying this compared to the two dozen graph contributors from the last 3 months, across 8+ teams.

> From the beginning of the project, Andrew worked very well on this project by planning and estimating the frontend work. He developed request/approval workflows with no issues and other teams promptly starting using casual user request workflow. In planning and estimation part, Andrew was very organized and made sure to align with requirements, UI and backend designs that allows him to execute the development phase smoothly and be transparent about his progress. At the end of quarter, he delivered a great demo for the parts that he committed to finish. Andrew also collaborated with other teams to make sure everyone is aligning on the dependency components. Thank you Andrew for your great work in Power/Casual seats project. Andrew is one of the key engineers to make this project very smooth.
