### 2020 to Present

I joined as a **Senior Frontend Engineer** on the Enteprise team and then moved into an **Engineer Manager** role in 2022, on a small team where I still do daily code contributions. I was promoted to **Engineering Manager** where I lead our Web Experience team. Our mandate is to build tools and technologies to increase the velocity of other teams including common **React** components, advocating for best practices, and helping with larger inter-team projects. Since our team is small, I still spend at least 50% of my time as an individual contributor.

## Projects

### React Components

I lead the initiative to migrate 100% of our common **React** component library to Typescript. This process uncovered a number of bugs and has helped ensure that we are not making unintentional breaking changes going forward. In additional, I used the React Profiler API to generate performance metrics for individual components which allows us to ensure that they remain performant with the addition of new features. As we invest in performance, we can now track and ensure render times for components are improving over time.

### Modernization project

I lead a team to modernize B2B enterprise features on a new web platform based on React / GraphQL. I migrated a substantial portion of our enterprise product over to the new technology stack. This project included lots of mentorship for those around me.

### GraphQL

Re-architected our **GraphQL** layer so that users could query information owned by other users. This was key in order for Admin accounts to be able to view and manager the users on their team. With this in place, I was able to create features such as allowing admins to transfer surveys from one user on their team to another.

### Microservices

Even though my role was strictly a frontend role, I still contributed to **microservices** where needed. The entirety of the GraphQL Schema is defined and maintained by frontend developers at SurveyMonkey. In addition, I contributed to other microservices, for example by adding REST and GraphQL APIs to expose our SOLR search database in a secure way.

### Quotes from Performance Review

> Andrew has been doing some of the best Graph work I've seen in a whileâ€‹. I have the unique perspective of being able to compare his contributions from a technical and social aspect and he's been killing it on both fronts. And I'm saying this compared to the two dozen graph contributors from the last 3 months, across 8+ teams.

> From the beginning of the project, Andrew worked very well on this project by planning and estimating the frontend work. He developed request/approval workflows with no issues and other teams promptly starting using casual user request workflow. In planning and estimation part, Andrew was very organized and made sure to align with requirements, UI and backend designs that allows him to execute the development phase smoothly and be transparent about his progress. At the end of quarter, he delivered a great demo for the parts that he committed to finish. Andrew also collaborated with other teams to make sure everyone is aligning on the dependency components. Thank you Andrew for your great work in Power/Casual seats project. Andrew is one of the key engineers to make this project very smooth.

> Andrew had recently joined the Web Platform team and apart from on-boarding/ramping up, he implemented a great solution for AuthAPI. The sense of ownership to deliver on this and to ensure Web Platform is setup for success!
