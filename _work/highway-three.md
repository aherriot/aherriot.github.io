## 2013 to 2014

Highway Three Solutions is a small web application contractor in Victoria, BC. Most of my time is spent using SQL (Oracle, PL/SQL, MySql), JavaScript (JQuery, KnockoutJs, JQGrid), and Java to write software for the BC Ministry of Transportation. I helped create an administration app for the National Safety Code project, which pulls in collision data from across the continent to assess whether commercial vehicles are meeting safety standards.

I also did some work on Drupal sites using PHP and MySql. Another project involved converting large amount of government mainframe data into an Oracle Database using shell scripts and a series of PL/SQL Scripts.
