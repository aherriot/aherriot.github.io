As a joke, I made a fully functioning parody of Tripadvisor for tourists to review potato chips using React, Node/Express, and Postgres.

As you can see from the screenshots, this web app allows users to add and review their favourite potato chips so that we can collectively find the perfect chip. I am surprised just how popular it became around the office and has sparked some serious questions about what makes a great potato chip.
