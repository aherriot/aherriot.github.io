"Anything, but..." is an webapp to solve the problem of finding a restaurant to eat together. It is very challenging to agree on a restaurant because everyone has strong preferences that are hard to express in a group setting. This removes the challenges by allowing people to anonymously provide their preferences without the peer pressure to be flexible.

If there is a restaurant that everyone likes, the app will stop and present the result to all participants.

The app is built using Next.js, React, Typescript, [headlessui](https://headlessui.com/), Google Places API, and [instantdb](https://www.instantdb.com) for the persistance and state synchronization.
