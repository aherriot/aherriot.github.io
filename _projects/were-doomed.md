I made an web version of the boardgame "We're Doomed" that runs in the browser and supports multiplayer with a central NodeJS server hosted on Heroku. It uses the wonderful boardgame.io library which provides a good abstraction for state management and client synchronization. The frontend uses React, Typescript, and Tailwind CSS. It is hosted at [were-doom.herokuapp.com](https://were-doomed.herokuapp.com/).
