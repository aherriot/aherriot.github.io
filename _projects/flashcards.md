A curated flashcard app for Persian language learners using React, Redux, Express, and MongoDB.

This app uses a curated list of Persian words and phrases that are managed by me, but it allows other users to study the shared set of flashcards and track their progress independently.

I made this project for three reasons:

1.  I was disappointed with the lack of good Persian language learning resources on the internet. Most of what I have found is full of errors and inconsistencies.
2.  I want a better card selection algorithm that would focus on words that I struggle with, so this app has the option to study least known, least recent, and random words.
3.  I wanted something that tracks the progress of translating Persian to English independently of English to Persian, which I find more helpful. This may be the only flashcard app that does this.
