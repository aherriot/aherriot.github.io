Catapult is a game that I created using GameMaker for a contest at UVic. I was the first runner up out of thirteen teams, making an artillery shooting game with deformable terrain. While the interface to the game was its downfall, I am still very proud of the technical achievement I was able to do in GameMaker.

While most games made with this tool are simple platform games, similar to super mario, I was able to create a clone of the classic Worms game in just a few days of work. The terrain is my proudest achievement in the project, where the resolution of the dirt increases as more fidelity is needed.
